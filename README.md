My projects made on freeCodeCamp.

## Responsive Web Design

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

### Survey Form

I built a survey form to collect data from users.
